<h1>Text to Base64 Encoder</h1>

This is a simple Python script that encodes a string of text to its equivalent base64 representation.

## Usage

To use this script, simply run it from the command line. You will be prompted to enter the text you want to encode. The script will then print the base64 encoded string of the entered text.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the script:

```
python3 encoder.py
Enter the text to encode: Hello World!
SGVsbG8gV29ybGQh
```


In this example, 

The script was run and the user entered 

`"Hello World!"` as the text to encode. 

The script then printed the base64 encoded string 

`"SGVsbG8gV29ybGQh"`.
